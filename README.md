# DIP-project-8th-semester

1 . dataset --> " 1.dataset.rar "

2 . trained model (using yolo v8) --> " fireModel.pt "

3 . google colab link where the model was trained --> "https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1XztJ3MkzoRrGQcIVyXjoeCET1dVYBZa0?pli=1#scrollTo=ts7_MCqg0GtG"

4 . fire detection code(run in vscode) --> "FireCodeYolo.py" 







N.B.

-> dataset collected from kaggle

-> for training the model dataset was uploaded in google drive and mounted the drive in colab.

-> In low light it detects other fire-familiar objects as fire

-> yolo models works very slow in CPU, ideal for GPU

=========CODING IN PROGRESS============

-> alarm system coding part

-> send a remote alarm to the admin via email coding part
